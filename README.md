## Algorithms

In a project Algorithm.pprj collected functionality for visual creation of algorithms. Algorithms are created using drag-and-drop of standard blocks from a palette on a canvas of a flow-chart and following connection them by stream lines. After that the standard blocks are filled with clojure code as of "let" macro body.  

Important distinction of these algorithms from a common notion of algorithm in that they can represent parallel processes. For this purpose to standard blocks added two new ones: "Concurrent" and "Wait". Full list of blocks is following:
..* Input
..* Process
..* Decision
..* Predefined processes
..* Concurrent
..* Wait

If you want to add this functionality to your own project you need to include Algorithm.pprj project into it. This can be done by "Project -> Manage Included Projects.." menu item.

Algorithm examples in AlgorithmExamples.pprj project.
